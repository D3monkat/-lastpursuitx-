# How to add new Items

Here's everything you need to know about adding new items to the script

## Creating a new Player Slot
First off you would need to create a new player slot, this is done by adding a new line to the `local PlayerSlots` table in utils/client.lua, here's an example of how it would look like

```lua
    { -- More contraband that will be on a player somewhere
        {bone = 24817, pos = vec3(-0.38, -0.24, 0.15), rot = vec3(0.0, 92.0, -13.0)},
        {bone = 24817, pos = vec3(-0.37, -0.24, 0.15), rot = vec3(0.0, 92.0, 13.0)},
    },

    -- It can be quite hard to get the actual placements I have used this one and I would highly recommend it
    -- https://forum.cfx.re/t/paid-dev-tool-prop-attach-to-ped-tool/4782266
```

Note that this is actually not real placements just a showcase of how its done

## Adding a new Weapon
Here you must have have a PlayerSlot thats ready and defined heres an example of how to add a new weapon, in this case I will use player slot number 1 which is used for bigger weapons that should stick out of the players back.

```lua
    weapon_rpg = {
        slot = 1
    },
```
